This is more or less an easy way to add all the sound commands to your stream. 
Fill a folder with .mp3 files, name each file as the command you want it to be. 
Load up your chatbot and pass in the path to that folder. Set everything else 
and then the script will take care of playing all of those sounds as commands. 

Example path: G:\chatbot_sounds\mp3\

(the \ at the end is very important)

All sound commands will be the name with a ! at the start. For example a sound named:
"shouting" will become a command "!shouting".
